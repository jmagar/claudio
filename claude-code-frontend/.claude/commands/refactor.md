# Refactor Code

Improve code structure, readability, and maintainability without changing functionality.

## Instructions

1. **Code Analysis**
   - Identify code smells and areas for improvement
   - Look for duplicated code patterns
   - Check for overly complex functions or components
   - Analyze dependencies and coupling between modules

2. **Refactoring Strategy**
   - Extract reusable functions and components
   - Simplify complex conditional logic
   - Improve naming conventions for clarity
   - Optimize imports and dependencies

3. **Implementation Steps**
   - Make small, incremental changes
   - Ensure tests pass after each change
   - Update documentation and comments
   - Verify performance isn't negatively impacted

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run full test suite
   - Check for any breaking changes
   - Validate that functionality remains unchanged
   - Update related documentation

This command guides through systematic code refactoring to improve maintainability.
