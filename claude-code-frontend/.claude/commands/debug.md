# Debug Command

Analyze and debug issues in the codebase systematically.

## Instructions

1. **Identify the Problem**
   - Review the error message or issue description
   - Locate the relevant code files and components
   - Check recent changes that might have caused the issue

2. **Analysis Steps**
   - Examine the code structure and flow
   - Look for common patterns that might be problematic
   - Check for missing dependencies or imports
   - Verify configuration files and environment setup

3. **Debugging Strategy**
   - Add appropriate logging and debugging statements
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Verify data flow and state management
   - Check for race conditions or timing issues

4. **Solution Implementation**
   - Implement the fix with minimal impact
   - Add error handling and validation
   - Update tests and documentation
   - Verify the fix doesn't introduce new issues

This command helps systematically approach debugging complex issues in the codebase.
